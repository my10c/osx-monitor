# osx-monitor

- simple OSX monitor script that can be used with nagios or naemon

### Background

Back in 2012 i needed to monitor 20+ Apple server with nagios, deployed with salt-stack, and 
so 1 coded these 4 scripts.

Recently, 2025, I use the same scripts to monitor 400+ Mac mini and use ansible to deploy and
naemon to monitor and no issue.
